## About Me

Hello and welcome to my GIS portfolio! My name is Leanna Navo and I'm a senior at the University of Miami, triple majoring in Ecosystem Science & Policy, Geography & Sustainable Development, and Spanish. I have taken and excelled in 4 GIS-based courses at the university. Through those courses, I have developed a passion for cartography having learned the necessity of GIS in sustainable decision-making. I've grown a strong interest in hydrogeology through my internship with Miami-Dade County Water and Sewer Department's Hydrotechnical Services Division from May to December of 2025. My internship exposed me to the reality of the GIS's role in most matters, from tracking saltwater intrusion to fulfilling regulatory obligations such as AoRs. Thus, not only have I explored real-world applications through my coursework, but I've seen GIS at play in the real world! I'm ready to get to mapping with a purpose!

> “Always say “yes” to the present moment. What could be more futile, more insane, than to create inner resistance to what already is? what could be more insane than to oppose life itself, which is now and always now? Surrender to what is. Say “yes” to life — and see how life suddenly starts working for you rather than against you.”
